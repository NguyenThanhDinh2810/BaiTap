            Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming
            language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991,
            Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its
            notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and
            object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear,
            logical code for small and large-scale projects. Python is
            dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple
            programming paradigms, including structured (particularly,
            procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is
            often described as a "batteries included" language due to its
            comprehensive standard library. Python was conceived in the late
            1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Python 2.0, released in
            2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage
            collection system with reference counting.
